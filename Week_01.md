Answer the following questions considering the learning outcomes for
- [Week 01](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week01-project01-basics/learning-outcomes/)

Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
#### HTML Forms

* Utilised forms to allow user inputs
* Learnt how user input data can be processed
* Learnt how I can implement forms to ensure they are fully accessible
* Learnt a more efficient way to assign user data to object properties

  ``` j
  const contactData = {
    name: document.getElementById('name').value,
    email: document.getElementById('email').value,
    company: document.getElementById('company').value,
    number: document.getElementById('number').value,
    reason: document.getElementById('reason').value,
    moreInfo: document.getElementById('more-info').value
  };  
  ```


 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
#### GitHub

* Although I struggled initially I believe I am now confident using branches and repos
* I thought I would struggle a lot more with working within a team and sharing my ideas but my team got on really well.

## Feedback (For CF's)
#### Alex

[What went well]

Looks like you really took responsibility for forms in your team and did your own research to improve your skills.

[Even better if]

You could enumerate some other topics, even if they were assigned to someone else in your team. You can give a very brief description (one or two lines) about topics like the dynamic generation of cards, complex event listeners (in case you have those in your project). Your addition of the code snippet is great, keep adding more for each topic that would benefit from having an example.
