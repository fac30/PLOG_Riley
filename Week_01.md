## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
#### HTML Forms
* Implemented form elements to capture user input
* Gained understanding of user data processing mechanisms
* Explored techniques to enhance form accessibility
* Discovered an efficient method for assigning user input to object properties
  ``` j
  const userSubmission = {
    name: document.querySelector('#name').value,
    email: document.querySelector('#email').value,
    company: document.querySelector('#company').value,
    number: document.querySelector('#number').value,
    reason: document.querySelector('#reason').value,
    additionalInfo: document.querySelector('#additional-info').value
  };  
  ```

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
#### GitHub
* Initially found it challenging, but now feel more confident with branch management and repository operations
* Surprised by how well I adapted to team collaboration and idea sharing, despite initial apprehensions

## Feedback (For CF's)
#### Alexander
[What went well]
It's evident that you took ownership of the forms aspect within your team and conducted independent research to enhance your skills.

[Even better if]
You could provide brief overviews of other topics, even those assigned to teammates. Consider adding concise descriptions (one or two sentences) about aspects like dynamic card generation or complex event listeners (if applicable to your project). Your inclusion of a code snippet is commendable; continue to incorporate more for topics that would benefit from practical examples.
